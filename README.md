# ML Translation using Transformers 

## Overview
This project focuses on **Machine Translation (MT)** using **Transformer models**. It leverages pre-trained models to perform translation between multiple languages efficiently. The implementation is done in **Google Colab** to ensure easy access to necessary resources.

## Features
- **Pre-trained Transformer Models**: Uses models like **Hugging Face's MarianMT, mBART, or T5** for translation.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Translates text between multiple language pairs.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Runs efficiently on cloud-based Colab notebooks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses BLEU and ROUGE scores to measure translation quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
- **Torch / TensorFlow**
- **NLTK / SacreBLEU**
- **Google Colab**

## Installation
1. Open Google Colab and upload the notebook `ML_Translation.ipynb`.
2. Install required dependencies by running the following in a Colab cell:
   ```python
   !pip install transformers torch sentencepiece nltk sacrebleu
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Translation Model in Google Colab
1. Open the Colab notebook and run all cells sequentially.
2. Modify input text and specify language pairs to test different translations.
3. Evaluate results using BLEU/ROUGE scores.

## Customization
- Modify `ML_Translation.ipynb` to use different Transformer models (e.g., T5, mBART, MarianMT).
- Fine-tune a model using domain-specific data.
- Extend support for additional languages.

## Future Enhancements
- **Fine-Tuning**: Train models on custom datasets for specialized translation.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine rule-based and neural translation for better accuracy.
- **Web Interface**: Deploy via a simple web UI or API.
